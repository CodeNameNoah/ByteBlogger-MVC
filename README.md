# ByteBlogger-MVC

I am proud to say that I have built a CMS-style blog site that resembles WordPress, designed specifically for developers to publish their blog posts and interact with other developersâ€™ posts through comments. The site is deployed using Heroku, making it easily accessible for users to engage with.

## Description

Throughout the development process, I ensured that the application followed the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm for its architectural structure. I chose Handlebars.js as the templating language, as it provides a simple and intuitive syntax for generating HTML pages. Additionally, Sequelize was utilized as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to interact with the database, streamlining the process of managing data.

One of the most critical features of this blog site is its ability to authenticate users. To accomplish this, I used the express-session npm package for authentication, which allows users to log in and securely access their profile pages, view their blog posts and comments, as well as interact with other developers' posts.

Overall, I am excited about the potential this blog site has to help developers share their knowledge and insights with others in their field. I believe that it will foster a community of developers who can collaborate and learn from one another.

## Featured Code Snippet

```
async function commentFormHandler(event) {
  event.preventDefault();

  const comment_text = document.querySelector('textarea[name="comment-body"]').value.trim();
  const post_id = window.location.toString().split('/')[
    window.location.toString().split('/').length - 1
  ];

  if (comment_text) {
    const response = await fetch('/api/comments', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({
        post_id,
        comment_text
      }),
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    });

    if (response.ok) {
      document.location.reload();
    } else {
      alert(response.statusText);
    }
  }
}

document.querySelector('.comment-form').addEventListener('submit', commentFormHandler);

```

- This is where the magic happens, it was quite fun working out the hiccups I must admit.

This is an asynchronous JavaScript function commentFormHandler that is used to handle the submission of a comment form. The function is triggered when a user submits a form with the class comment-form.

First, the function prevents the default form submission behavior using event.preventDefault(). Then it extracts the text entered by the user from the textarea element with the name "comment-body" and trims any leading or trailing whitespace from the text.

It also extracts the post ID from the current window location URL by splitting the URL by '/' and taking the last element in the resulting array.

If the comment text is not empty, the function sends a POST request to the server's API endpoint /api/comments using the fetch method. The body of the request is a JSON object that includes the post ID and the comment text. The Content-Type header is set to application/json.

If the response is successful (i.e., the server returns a 2xx status code), the browser reloads the current page to display the new comment. Otherwise, an error message is displayed using alert(response.statusText).

Finally, the function is registered as an event listener for the form's submit event using addEventListener.
